# Wildpulse

This is a project which has been on my mind for sometime. It is a nature/biodiversity focussed social media platform which i am building to learn some concepts related to product engineering in general. This is the front-end. The backend code is available here: <https://github.com/archdemon-developer/wildpulse-backend>

## Technologies Used

Technologies used in this project are:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vue.js
- Typescript
- vite
- Pinia
- Vue router
- Vitest
- v8
- Google Cloud Platform
  (Technologies used will be updated here as and when added).

## Installation

First, clone this project using git, and navigate into the project folder:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/archdemon-developer/wildpulse-ui.git
  cd wildpulse-ui
```

Then, install the required dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

That's it! Start the dev server using

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Build the project using

```bash
  npm run build
```

## Running Tests

This project uses Vitest for unit testing. To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
  npm run test
```

If you want to see your test coverage, then run:

- Modular code - Adhere to Vue.js coding practices wherever possible.
- Clean coding practices
- Unit testing

**Essential Features:**

- Login/Signup Page - in progress - integration with GCP Identity platform completed.

**Optional Features:**
